# Executive Dashboard -- P&L
High Level / Executive Summary of P&amp;L using DACC data.

This repo houses Tableau Workbook files (.twbx) for a project that visualizes the Profit & Loss Statement accounts at a high level. The audience is primarily excutive leardership, brand leadership, Finance Managers, or other analysts that need a high level overview of the P&L with the ability to filter by time periods, Brands and Markets.

We will be adding a third hierarchy to the DACC data eventually. So this will give users the option to view the data in the dashboard by: (1) Beverages - Regions; (2) Global Travel Retail (GTR); or (3) Country/Market. The third option (Country/Market) is the hierarchy that is being added.
